Independent-Samples t-test
Compares means of two independent groups (example: Cheese vs. Pepperoni eating time).
Assumptions: interval or ratio dependent variable, random samples, normal distribution, equal variances.
Check normality with histograms; test equal variances with Levene’s test.
Use t.test() with var.equal = TRUE or FALSE depending on variance test.
If p < 0.05 then reject null (groups differ).
Effect size: Cohen’s d (0.2 small, 0.5 medium, 0.8 or more large).
Power analysis: use pwr.t.test, 80 percent power is acceptable.

Mann-Whitney U test
Used when data are not normally distributed.
Compares medians instead of means.
Assumes groups have similarly shaped distributions.
Null hypothesis: group medians are equal.
Effect size: rank-biserial correlation r (0.1 small, 0.3 medium, 0.5 large).
Sample size can be calculated with pwr.2p2n.test.
Use wilcox.test() to run the test; rank\_biserial() gives effect size.
Less powerful than t-test but valid for non-normal data.

Chi-Square test of independence
Tests whether two categorical variables are related (example: topping type and willingness to eat again).
Works with frequency tables; null hypothesis means variables are independent.
Requires large sample sizes, about 1000 or more, and at least 5 observations per cell.
Effect size: Cramer’s V (w) (0.1 small, 0.3 medium, 0.5 large).
Sample size and power analysis with pwr.chisq.test.
Shows association but not causation.

Fisher’s Exact test
Alternative to Chi-square for small samples or when more than 20 percent of cells have expected counts below 5.
Most often used for 2 by 2 tables; gives exact p-values.
Null hypothesis: no relationship between variables.
Effect size: odds ratio (1.5 small, 2.5 medium, 4 large).
Use fisher.test() to run the test.
Power analysis with pwr.2p.test.
More reliable for small or unbalanced datasets.
